Daoine is a Lightweight WordPress and WooCommerce plugin that simplifies the sign-up process for onboarding new customers and users.

== Description ==

If you are a WordPress - WooCommerce website owner, your users might likely have faced issues while Signing up on the website. By default, WordPress and WooCommerce require users to write very long passwords which might be good for security but, it impacts user experience.

We disagree with projects that say 10 letters in a password are considered a weak password. We are building this WordPress-WooCommerce plugin to fix the User Experience impacts.
